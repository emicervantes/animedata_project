One such God Eater is Lenka Utsugi, a New-Type whose God Arc takes the form of both blade and gun.\\n\\nNow, as one of Fenrir's greatest weapons, Lenka must master his God Arc if he is to fulfill his desire of wiping out the Aragami once and for all. The monsters continue to be born en masse while the remnants of humanity struggle to survive the night.
