Hello! My name is emi, and I am a huge anime fan! My favorite anime is Jujutsu Kaisen. The big question of this app is to find if the time each anime was aired determined its genre. I created a model using Scikit-learn LogisticRegression algorithm to predict the genre of anime based on its score and the time it was aired. Another feature that I added was the anime recommendation engine using Scikit-learn with a concept of cosine similarity.
